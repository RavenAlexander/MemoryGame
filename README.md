# YuGiOh Memory Game

## Overview

This is a memory game inspired by the card game "Yu-Gi-Oh!" using React. The application's UI is split into four components.


## Instructions

1. Create a new React application using `create-react-app`, or download this file and use the command `yarn` or `npm i` to download the associated packages. Then, `yarn start` or `npm start` will launch the app!

2. The app will render 12 different images to the screen.

3. The app keeps track of the user's score. The user's score increments when clicking an image for the first time. The user's score will be reset to 0 if they click the same image more than once.

4. Every time an image is clicked, the images rendered to the page are randomly shuffled.

5. Once the user's score is reset after an incorrect guess, the game restarts.
